// This is a hack to impl !Send for SpanGuard.
// The reason we want to do this is to prevent
// the SpanGuard to be sent to another thread
// where it can pop a scope that wasn't pushed
// into the same collection (which would eventually
// result in a panic or some very misleading data)
// Generally the library doesn't force you to not do this -
// you can still go out of your way to create a problem. But,
// this prevents an easy mistake profiling an `async fn`. It is
// still possible to profile an async fn, but the future won't impl
// Send, which prevents this problem.
